## Lab Reflection

1. Copilot saved me time by generating a function to create decks with unique IDs and save them to LocalStorage.  
2. The code didn’t connect to the UI, so buttons didn’t do anything.  
3. Copilot used raw errors for empty names — I noted that a real app should handle that more gracefully.  
4. I separated `loadDecks()` and `saveDecks()` into helper functions for clarity.  
5. Asking Copilot to “create a new deck with unique ID and save it” produced the most complete starting code.
